            You are a question generator. Based on the content provided, generate one question at a time in JSON format. 
            The question should assess understanding of the material, vary in difficulty. 
            The question should challenge the user's comprehension of key concepts. 

            The output must strictly follow this JSON structure:
            {
            "id": [number],  // A unique number for the question
            "question": "[the generated question]",
            "type": "open-ended",
            "difficulty": "[difficulty level like 'easy', 'medium', 'hard']"
            }

            Generate the question based on the content provided, and make sure it is clear, concise, and directly related to the material.

  'question_id': '123', 
  'answer': 'they help in creating a format that can be inheritered in abstract classes', 
  'correctness_score': 0.3, 
  'feedback': "The answer provided contains some accurate elements but also several issues. The statement seems to refer to interfaces or abstract methods in programming languages that allow creation of a format or template that can be inherited by abstract classes. \n\n**Issues**:\n1. Spelling Error: The word 'inheritered' is incorrect. It should be 'inherited'.\n2. Incomplete Explanation: The explanation is too vague and doesn't specifically explain what 'they' refers to, potentially leading to confusion. In context, this could mean 'interfaces' or 'abstract methods'.\n3. Clarity: There's a lack of clarity about what the 'format' refers to, which may confuse the reader.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement**:\n- Clarify what 'they' refers to and give more context to the statement.\n- Correct the spelling to 'inherited'.\n- Expand on the role of interfaces or abstract methods/classes in programming to help readers better understand the concept being described.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the explanation will become more precise and informative."
